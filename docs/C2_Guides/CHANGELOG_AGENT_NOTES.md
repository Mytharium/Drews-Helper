# Changelog Agent Notes

## 2026-08-06

- Built Drew's Helper RuneLite plugin scaffold and local Gradle run path.
- Added Shortest Path route-feed bridge using plugin messages and `postTransports=true`.
- Added overlay rendering for route transport telemetry.
- Fixed overlay width/formatting so long route text is not squeezed into the narrow right column.
- Added locked-teleport availability checks for Drew-owned display/highlight behavior.
- Replaced the broad "all minigame teleports unlocked" model with per-destination Grouping/minigame UI scanning.
- Added Grouping UI widget walking across children, dynamic children, static children, and nested children.
- Added visible-bounds clipping so scrolled-off minigame rows are not highlighted.
- Added per-destination minigame status persistence through RuneLite config.
- Fixed the persistence bug where render-time scanning updated memory without saving config.
- Added saved route snapshot and Shortest Path target replay across plugin toggle, logout, world hop, and client restart.
- Updated overlay to show `Current Route Step X/Y`, the full numbered transport list, `Minigame Teleports`, and numbered `Locked Routes`.
- Passed spirit-tree and fairy-ring unlock settings through to Shortest Path category-level config overrides.

## Open Technical Note

Exact locked-route rerouting is not implemented yet. Drew can detect locked minigame destinations and list them, but the installed Shortest Path plugin only exposes category-level config overrides through its plugin-message API. Per-destination rerouting needs a Shortest Path exclusion API or a Drew-owned solver.
